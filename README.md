# A Link Between Worlds SPICA
This is a tool for handling BCH files (the primary format for albw's object models). Using this tool, it is *technically* possible to import a model (currently SMD or BCH only), deserialize models (so you can see them) and serialize models (so they can be exported). This means that you can edit models and change how they look in game.

## Current Features 🔆

* BCH model viewing 🖼️
* BCH de/serialization 📥📤
* SMD de/serialization 📥📤
* DAE serialization 📤

## Upcoming (hopefully 🤞) Features 📅

* DAE deserialization 📥
* UV mapping support for albw 🗺️
* Streamline codebase for albw usage 🚂
* Create a release for public use 🚀

## Technically 🔬
As stated above, it is *technically* possible to use this tool as an end-to-end solution for editing albw models. In practice, this isn't very easy and the results are below the standards that I would like. I am working to improve this but this takes time and patience - especially since this project is quite big and mostly undocumented.

If you want to use this tool and would like help figuring things out, join the [ALBW Modding discord](https://discord.gg/zNMBw8q) and one of the amazing people there *might* be able to help you.

## Helping Out 🤝
If you want to help make this tool better, join the [ALBW Modding discord](https://discord.gg/zNMBw8q) and say so! This is largely a reverse-engineering effort so any help is greatly appreciated.

## Acknowledgements 💌
This is a modification of [HelloOO7](https://github.com/HelloOO7/SPICA)'s extension of [gdkchan](https://github.com/gdkchan/SPICA)'s experimental H3D tool for serializing/deserializing BCH.

This is a fork-of-a-fork so it is advisable to look at the previous versions of this tool before delving too deep.

See `README.fork.md` for the README of HelloOO7's version.
